## Background

### context

I was working on a progam which involves c#, c++, matlab, cuda code, but most of it is **c#**; it has about 10k LOCs, has a computing part and a graphical user interface (GUI) part, it has **MVVM** pattern, and uses **Prism** and **Unity** for **DI** patterns; it has unit tests, even though it's not **TDD**.

I'm following the patterns, especially  MVVM, and have one huge **View Model** class for the main view.
